## üöÄ About This Project

This is my personal portfolio, developed entirely with Flutter. The main goal of this project was to apply and deepen my knowledge in responsive web development using the technologies I work with daily. As a developer in career transition, this portfolio serves as a practical showcase of my current skills in creating modern and accessible interfaces.

The project is designed to be fully responsive, offering an optimized experience for both desktop and mobile devices.
